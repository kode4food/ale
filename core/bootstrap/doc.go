// Package bootstrap performs initial setup of the Ale runtime environment. It
// populates a new Environment with all core functions, macros, special forms,
// and standard library definitions. Create a new `*env.Environment` and pass
// it to `Into` to initialize a complete Ale runtime ready for code evaluation.
