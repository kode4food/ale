// Package builtin provides core runtime functions implemented in Go that form
// the foundation of Ale's standard library. These include essential operations
// like I/O, type checking, sequence manipulation, and system integration that
// require direct access to Go's capabilities or are more efficient when
// implemented natively rather than in Ale itself.
