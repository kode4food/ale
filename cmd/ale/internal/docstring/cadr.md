These are compound sequence accessors that combine multiple `car` and `cdr` operations. The name of each function describes which operations to perform from right to left:

- `a` represents `car` (get first element)
- `d` represents `cdr` (get rest of list)

#### Examples

Given a nested list structure:

```scheme
(define x '((1 2) (3 4)))
(caar x)  ; gets car of (car x) -> 1
(cadr x)  ; gets car of (cdr x) -> (3 4)
(cdar x)  ; gets cdr of (car x) -> (2)
(cddr x)  ; gets cdr of (cdr x) -> ()

;; More deeply nested examples
(define y '((1 2) ((3 4) 5)))
(cadar y)  ; car of (cdr of (car y)) -> 2
(caadr y)  ; car of (car of (cdr y)) -> (3 4)
```

The functions can access up to 4 levels deep in a nested list structure. Reading from right to left helps understand the access pattern - for example, `caddr` means "get the first element (car) of the rest of the rest (cddr) of the list".
