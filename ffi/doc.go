// Package ffi provides Foreign Function Interface capabilities that enable
// seamless integration between Ale and Go code. It handles marshaling and
// unmarshaling between native Go values and Ale's value types, allowing Go
// functions to be called from Ale code and Ale values to be used in Go
// applications that embed the Ale interpreter.
